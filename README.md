Prepare a framework (Frontend React/Vue; Backend: express/koa/any other framework with language that is commonly used for backend server) such that:

- Create a websocket channel (preferably socketio) for backend to populate data to frontend;
- Restful API for CRUD;
- Register a function to constantly modify data every several seconds, while not disturbing web services;
- (Bonus): connect to a database for persisting data;
- (Bonus): use a 3-tier structure (frontend + web server + application server);
- (Bonus): token-based authentication;
- (Bonus): use of TypeScript;
  You would need to modify this on the spot during on site test.
